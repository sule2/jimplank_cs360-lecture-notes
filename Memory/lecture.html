<H1> Before I Start </h1>

(This was written in 2018.)
This lecture material can be problematic, because memory layout, and the primitives
used to explore them are typically not POSIX standards, and can differ from operating
system to operating system.  Fortunately, the concepts are easy to map from one machine to
another, but I can understand your frustration if things become confusing on a new machine.
<p>
Fortunately, Raspberry Pi's using the Raspbian operating system are pretty clean, 32-bit
machines.  The output that you see below will be on a Pi, so if you have access
to one and want to follow along, then please do so.  Most Linux OS's will come close to
what you see here, so long as you are ready for 64-bit pointers.  If you compile these
programs with <b>-32</b> on a 64-bit Linux machine, you'll get nicer looking pointers.

<H1> Memory </h1>

This lecture is an introduction to memory as we see it in Unix.
<p>
<p>As I have said previously, memory is like a huge array with 
2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> elements, depending on whether you are 
running in 32 or 64-bit mode.
A pointer in C is an index to this array.  Thus when 
a C pointer is <tt>0xefffe034</tt>, it points to the <tt>0xefffe035th</tt> element in 
the memory array (memory being indexed starting with zero).

<p>You cannot access all elements of memory.  One example
that we have seen a lot is element 0.  If you try to dereference a 
pointer with a value of 0, you will get a segmentation violation.
This is Unix's way of telling you that that memory location is
illegal.

<p>For example, the following code will generate a segmentation violation:

<pre>
main()
{
  char *s;
  char c;

  s = (char *) 0;
  c = *s;
}
</pre>

As it turns out, there are 4 regions of memory that are legal.  They are:
<OL>
<LI><b>The code (or "text")</b>: These are the instructions of your program
<LI><b>The globals</b>: These are your global variables
<LI><b>The heap</b>: This is memory that you get from <b>malloc()</b>.
<LI><b>The stack</b>: This contains your local variables and procedure
                        arguments.
</OL>

If we view memory as a big array, the regions (or ``segments'') look
as follows:

<pre>
     |--------------| 0
     |              |
     |   void       |
     |              |
     |--------------| 0x10000
     |              |
     |  code        |
     |              |
     |--------------|
     |  void        |
     |--------------| 0x20000
     |              |
     |  globals     |
     |              |
     |--------------|
     |              |
     |  heap        |
     |              |
     ||||||||||||||||
     |vvvvvvvvvvvvvv|
     |              |
     |              |
     |  void        |
     |              |
     |              |
     |^^^^^^^^^^^^^^|
     ||||||||||||||||
     |              |
     |  stack       |
     |              | 0xefffffff
     |--------------|
</pre>

Note, the heap grows down as you make more <b>malloc()</b> calls, and the
stack goes up as you make nested procedure calls.

<h1>Paging</h1>

On the hydra machines, memory is broken up into 8192-byte chunks.  
These are called pages.  On some machines, pages are 4096 bytes -- this
is something set by the hardware.

<p>
The way memory works is as follows:  The operating system allocates
certain pages of memory for you.  Whenever you try to read to or write
from an address in memory, the hardware first checks with the operating
system to see if that address belongs to a page that has been allocated
for you.  If so, then it goes ahead and performs the read/write.  If
not, you'll get a segmentation violation.

<p>This is what happens when you do:

<pre>
  s = (char *) 0;
  c = *s;
</pre>

When you say "<b>c = *s</b>", the hardware sees that you
want to read memory location zero.  It checks
with the operating system, which says "I haven't
allocated the page containing location zero for you."  This results
in a segmentation violation.  

<p>The exact mechanics of paging are covered in
classes on Operating Systems.  I won't go into it
further here. 

<p>As it turns out, the first 8 pages on our hydra machines
are void.  This means that trying to read to or
write from any address from 0 to 0xffff will
result in a segmentation violation. 

<p>The next page (starting with address 0x10000)
starts the code segment.  This segment ends at
the variable <b>&etext</b>, which I'll go over in a bit.
The globals segment starts at page 0x20000.  It goes until
the variable <b>&end</b>.  The heap starts immediately
after <b>&end</b>, and goes up to <b>sbrk(0)</b>, which I'll
talk about still later.  The stack ends with
address 0xefffffff.  Its beginning changes with
the different procedure calls you make.  We'll go
over this more later in this lecture.  Every page
between the end of the heap 
and the beginning of the stack is void, and will generate a
segmentation violation upon accessing.

<hr>
<h1>&etext and &end.</h1>

(For more info on these variables, do <b>man etext</b>).

<p>These are two external variables that are defined as follows:

<pre>
extern etext;
extern end;
</pre>

Note that they are typeless.  You never use just
"<b>etext</b>" and "<b>end</b>."  Instead, you use their
addresses -- these point to the end of the text
and globals segments respectively. 

<p>Look at the program 
<a href=testaddr1.c><b>testaddr1.c</b></a>.  
This prints out
the addresses of <b>etext</b> and <b>end</b>.  Then it prints
out 6 values: 

<UL>
<LI><b>main</b> is a pointer to the first instruction of
    the <b>main()</b> procedure.  This is simply a
    location in the code segment, which should be 
    familiar to you from the assembler lectures.
<LI><b>I</b> is a global variable.  Thus <b>&I</b> should be an
    address in the globals segment.
<LI><b>i</b> is a local variable.  Thus <b>&i</b> should be an
    address in the stack.
<LI><b>argc</b> is an argument to <b>main()</b>.  Thus, <b>&argc</b>
    should be an address in the stack.
<LI><b>ii</b> is another local variable.  Thus, <b>&ii</b>
    should be an address in the stack.  However,
    <b>ii</b> is a pointer to memory that has been
    <b>malloc</b>'d.  Thus, <b>ii</b> should be an address in
    the heap.
</UL>

<p>When we run <b>testaddr1</b>, we get something like the following:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr1</b>
&etext = 0x11843
&end   = 0x21b5c

main   = 0x10b50
&I     = 0x21b54
&i     = 0xffbee104
&argc  = 0xffbee15c
&ii    = 0xffbee100
ii     = 0x21b70
UNIX>
</pre>

So, what this says is that the code segment goes
from 0x10000 to 0x11843.  The globals segment goes
from 0x20000 to 0x21b5c.  The heap goes from 0x21b5c
to some address greater than 0x21b70 (since <b>ii</b>
allocated 4 bytes starting at 0x21b70).  The stack
goes from some address less than 0xefffe8f8 to
0xefffffff.  All values that are printed by
<b>testaddr1</b> make sense.  

<hr>
Now, look at 
<a href=testaddr2.c><b>testaddr2.c</b></a>.  

<p>This is the first really gross piece of C code
that you'll see.  What it does is print out
<b>&etext</b> and <b>&end</b>, and then prompt the user
for an address in hexadecimal.  It puts that
address into the pointer variable <b>s</b>.  You should
never do this unless you are writing code like
this which is testing memory.  The first thing
that it does with <b>s</b> is try to read from that
memory location <b>(c = *s)</b>.  Then it tries to write
to the memory location <b>(*s = c)</b>.  This is a way
to see which memory locations are legal.  

<p>So, lets try it out with an illegal memory value of zero:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x0</b>
Reading 0x0:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

When we tried to read from memory location zero,
we got a seg fault.  This is because memory
location zero is in the void -- the hardware
recognized this by asking the operating system,
and then generating a segmentation violation. 

<p>Memory locations 0x0 to 0xffff are illegal -- if
we try any address in that range, we will get a
segmentation violation: 

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xffff</b>
Reading 0xffff:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x4abc</b>
Reading 0x4abc:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

<p>Memory location 0x10000 is in the code segment.  This should be a legal
address:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x10000</b>
Reading 0x10000:  127
Writing 127 back to  0x10000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

<p>You'll note that we were able to read from 0x10000 -- it gave us the
byte 127, which begins some instruction in the program.  However,
we got a seg fault when we wrote to 0x10000.  This is by design:
The code segment is read-only.  You can read from it, but you can't
write to it.  This makes sense, because you can't change your program
while it's running -- instead you have to recompile it, and rerun it.

<p>Now, what if we try memory location 0x11fff?  This is above &etext, so
it should be outside of the code segment:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x11fff</b>
Reading 0x11fff:  -48
Writing -48 back to  0x11fff:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX>
</pre>

You'll note that even though 0x11fff is an address
outside the code segment, we're still allowed to
read from it.  This is because the hardware
checks the with operating system to see if an
address's page has been allocated.  Since page 8
(0x10000 - 0x11fff) has been allocated for the code
segment, the hardware treats any address between 0x10000 and 0x11fff
as a legal address.  You can read from it, but its value is
meaningless.   

<p>Now, pages 9 to 15 are undreadable again:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x12000</b>
Reading 0x12000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x1f000</b>
Reading 0x1f000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

<p>The globals starts at 0x20000, so we see that the 16th page is
readable and writable:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x20000</b>
Reading 0x20000:  127
Writing 127 back to  0x20000:  ok
UNIX>          
</pre>

<p>We can read from and write to any location (0x20000 to 0x21fff)
in this page.  The next page (starting at 0x22000) is 
unreachable:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x21dff</b>
Reading 0x21dff:  0
Writing 0 back to  0x21dff:  ok
UNIX> <b>testaddr2</b>
&etext = 0x1191b
&end   = 0x21d90

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x22000</b>
Reading 0x22000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

<p>What this tells us is that the globals go from 0x20000 to 0x21d90.  The
heap goes from 0x21d90 up to some higher address in the same page.

<hr>
<h1>Sbrk(0)</h1>

<i>As with other parts of this lecture, <b>sbrk()</b> has grown to obsolescence.
Please see the next set of lecture notes on <b>malloc()</b> for some more current
information.</i>
<p>
<b>sbrk()</b> is a system call that we will get into in
a few lectures.  <b>sbrk(0)</b> returns to the user the
current end of the heap.  Since we can keep
calling <b>malloc()</b>, <b>sbrk(0)</b> can change over time.
<a href=testaddr3.c><b>testaddr3.c</b></a>
shows the value of <b>sbrk(0)</b> -- note it
is in page 16 (0x20000 - 0x21fff).  Since the hardware performs
its check in 8192-byte intervals, we can get at
any byte in page 16, even though <b>sbrk(0)</b> returns
0x20c78: 

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x21fff</b>
Reading 0x21fff:  0
Writing 0 back to  0x21fff:  ok
UNIX> 
</pre>

We haven't called <b>malloc()</b> in <b>testaddr3.c</b>.
This is the reason why <b>&end</b> and <b>sbrk(0)</b> return
the same value.  In <a href=testaddr3a.c><b>testaddr3a.c</b></a>
we make a <b>malloc()</b> call in the 
beginning of the program, and as you see, 
<b>&end</b> and <b>sbrk(0)</b> return different values:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr3a</b>
&etext = 0x119a3
&end   = 0x21e28
sbrk(0)= 0x23e28
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x23fff</b>
Reading 0x23fff:  0
Writing 0 back to  0x23fff:  ok
UNIX> <b>testaddr3a</b>
&etext = 0x119a3
&end   = 0x21e28
sbrk(0)= 0x23e28
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0x24000</b>
Reading 0x24000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

<hr>
<h1>The stack</h1>

So, where's the beginning of the stack?  If we try addresses above
0xffbee103 in <b>testaddr3</b>, we see that most of them are legal:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xffb00000</b>
Reading 0xffb00000:  0
Writing 0 back to  0xffb00000:  ok
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xff3f0000</b>
Reading 0xff3f0000:  0
Writing 0 back to  0xff3f0000:  ok
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xff3effff</b>
Reading 0xff3effff:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

What gives?  As it turns out, the operating system allocates all
pages from 0xff3f0000 to the bottom of the stack.  Where is the
bottom of the stack?  Let's probe:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xffbeffff</b>
Reading 0xffbeffff:  0
Writing 0 back to  0xffbeffff:  ok
UNIX> <b>testaddr3</b>
&etext = 0x11993
&end   = 0x21e18
sbrk(0)= 0x21e18
&c     = 0xffbee103

Enter memory location in hex (start with 0x): <b>0xffbf0000</b>
Reading 0xffbf0000:  Segmentation Fault
UNIX>
</pre>
So the stack goes from 0xff3f0000 to 0xffbeffff.  That is 
roughly 8 megabytes.
<p>You can print out the default stack size, and change it using 
the <b>limit</b> command (read the man page):
<pre>
UNIX> <b>limit</b>
...
stacksize       8192 kbytes
...
</pre>

Whenever you call a procedure, it allocates local
variables and arguments (plus a few other things)
on the stack.  Whenever you return from a
procedure, those varables are popped off the
stack.  So, look at 
<a href=testaddr4.c><b>testaddr4.c</b></a>.  
It has <b>main()</b>
call itself recursively as many times as there are
arguments.  You'll see that at each recursive
call, the addresses of <b>argc</b> and <b>argv</b> and the
local variable <b>i</b> are smaller addresses -- this is because
each time the procedure is called, the stack
grows upward to allocate its arguments and
local variables.  You've seen this already in the assembler
lectures.

<pre>
UNIX> <b>testaddr4</b>
argc = 1.  &argc = 0xffbee15c, &argv = 0xffbee160, &i = 0xffbee104
argc = 0.  &argc = 0xffbee0e4, &argv = 0xffbee0e8, &i = 0xffbee08c
UNIX> <b>testaddr4 v</b>
argc = 2.  &argc = 0xffbee154, &argv = 0xffbee158, &i = 0xffbee0fc
argc = 1.  &argc = 0xffbee0dc, &argv = 0xffbee0e0, &i = 0xffbee084
argc = 0.  &argc = 0xffbee064, &argv = 0xffbee068, &i = 0xffbee00c
UNIX> <b>testaddr4 v o l s</b>
argc = 5.  &argc = 0xffbee144, &argv = 0xffbee148, &i = 0xffbee0ec
argc = 4.  &argc = 0xffbee0cc, &argv = 0xffbee0d0, &i = 0xffbee074
argc = 3.  &argc = 0xffbee054, &argv = 0xffbee058, &i = 0xffbedffc
argc = 2.  &argc = 0xffbedfdc, &argv = 0xffbedfe0, &i = 0xffbedf84
argc = 1.  &argc = 0xffbedf64, &argv = 0xffbedf68, &i = 0xffbedf0c
argc = 0.  &argc = 0xffbedeec, &argv = 0xffbedef0, &i = 0xffbede94
UNIX> <b></b>
</pre>

Now, lets break the stack.  This can be done by writing a program 
that allocates too much stack memory.  One such program is in 
<a href=breakstack1.c><b>breakstack1.c</b></a>.  
It performs infinite recursion, and at each recursive step it allocates
10000 bytes of stack memory in the variable <b>iptr</b>.  When you run this,
you'll see that you get a segmentation violation when the recursive
call is made and the stack is about to dip below 0xff3f0000:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>breakstack1</b>
...
&c     = 0xff3fa347, iptr = 0xff3f7c30  ...  ok
&c     = 0xff3f7bbf, iptr = 0xff3f54a8  ...  ok
&c     = 0xff3f5437, iptr = 0xff3f2d20  ...  ok
Segmentation Fault
UNIX> 
</pre>

Often when you have infinite recursion and overflow the
stack, you get "illegal instruction" instead of Segmenation fault.
I can't explain this in detail-- just be ready for it...

<p>The second way to break the stack is to simply allocate too much local
memory.  E.g. look at 
<a href=breakstack2.c><b>breakstack2.c</b></a>.  
It tries to allocate 10M of memory
in the stack.   It segfaults in <b>a</b> because it tries to 
reference smaller memory addresses than 0xff3f0000.  Exactly where
does the seg fault happen?  Think about it -- answer below.
<p>
The segfault happens in <b>a</b> when the code attempts to push
<b>iptr</b> on the stack for the <b>printf</b> call.  This is because
the stack pointer is pointing to the void.  Had we not referenced
anything at the stack pointer, our program should have worked.  For
example, try 
<a href=breakstack3.c><b>breakstack3.c</b></a>.  
<pre>
UNIX> <b>breakstack3</b>
Calling a.  i = 1
After a is done.  i = 5
UNIX> 
</pre>
You should understand, and be able to explain this phenomenon.
