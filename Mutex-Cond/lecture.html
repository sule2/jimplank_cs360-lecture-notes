<h3>The pthread_mutex_t data structure</h3>

This text is copied from the <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/lecture.html>lecture
notes on race conditions (thread 2)</a>.
<p>

The pthreads library provides a simple data structure called a "mutex" that allows threads to synchronize by locking
and unlocking the data structure.  The three procedures that you use with mutexes are as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, NULL);
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You create a mutex with <b>pthread_mutex_init()</b>.  You have to have allocated memory for it ahead of time
(i.e. <b>pthread_mutex_init()</b> does not call <b>malloc()</b>. 
Then any thread may lock or unlock the mutex. When a thread locks the mutex, no other thread may lock it. 
If a thread calls <b>pthread_mutex_lock()</b> while the mutex is locked, then the thread 
will block until the mutex is unlocked. Only one thread may lock the mutex at a time.
<p>

The program <b><a href=mutex_example_1.c>mutex_example_1.c</a></b> is a simple illustration of a
mutex in action.  In this program, we fork off multiple threads.  Each thread has access to a shared
counter, and what each thread does is lock the mutex, update the counter, sleep for a bit, and then
unlock the mutex.  Before it unlocks the mutex, it checks to make sure that the counter has not
been altered while it was asleep.  The properties of the mutex data structure assure that this
works.  Here's the code.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

  pthread_mutex_t *lock;  <font color=blue>/* A lock to protect the counter. */</font>

    pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;lock);

You call this with the number of threads, and the number of microseconds that each 
thread sleeps.  Let's call it with 4 threads and 10,000 microseconds.  You'll see
that it works as anticipated -- the threads line up on the mutex, and each time
a thread unlocks the mutex, another thread grabs it and updates the counter:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make mutex_example_1</b></font>
gcc -o mutex_example_1 mutex_example_1.c -lpthread
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./mutex_example_1 4 10000 | head -n 20</b></font>

</pre>

<h3>What happens if we don't use a mutex</h3>

If we don't use a mutex, then the threads don't have exclusive access to the counter.
in <b><a href=mutex_example_2.c>mutex_example_2.c</a></b>, I have simply commented out
the <b>pthread_mutex_lock()</b> and 
<b>pthread_mutex_unlock()</b> calls.  Take a look at the output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make mutex_example_2</b></font>
gcc -o mutex_example_2 mutex_example_2.c -lpthread
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./mutex_example_2 4 10000 | head -n 20</b></font>
Thread:   0 - Begin - Counter   1.
Thread:   1 - Begin - Counter   2.
Thread:   2 - Begin - Counter   3.
Thread:   3 - Begin - Counter   4.
Thread:   0 - End   - Counter   4.
Thread 0 - Problem -- counter was 1, but now it's 4
Thread:   1 - End   - Counter   4.
Thread:   2 - End   - Counter   4.
Thread:   3 - End   - Counter   4.
UNIX>
</pre>

What you see here is that all of the threads update the counter, with thread 0 updating it first.
When thread 0 wakes up, the counter has been changed.  Interestingly, between the time that
it prints its error statement and the <b>exit(1)</b> call, threads 1, 2 and 3 wake up and
print their counters.  Then the <b>exit(1)</b> call kills the process.
<p>
This program is non-deterministic -- its output depends on the ordering of the threads by the
system.  Here's a second call, which is quite different:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./mutex_example_2 4 10000 | head -n 20</b></font>
Thread:   3 - Begin - Counter   3.
Thread:   1 - Begin - Counter   1.
Thread:   0 - Begin - Counter   1.
Thread:   2 - Begin - Counter   2.
Thread:   3 - End   - Counter   3.
Thread:   1 - End   - Counter   3.
Thread:   0 - End   - Counter   3.
Thread:   2 - End   - Counter   3.
Thread:   3 - Begin - Counter   4.
Thread 1 - Problem -- counter was 1, but now it's 4
Thread 0 - Problem -- counter was 1, but now it's 4
Thread 2 - Problem -- counter was 2, but now it's 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

There are two really interesting things here:

<UL>
<LI> Threads 0, 1 and 2 run before thread three, updating the counter, but thread 3's <b>fflush()</b> statement
is executed first. 
<LI> Threads 0 and 1 both accessed <b>counter</b> simultaneously, so they both read that its value was zero,
and updated it to 1.  That's a brutal race condition.
</UL>

I hope this output helps to motivate why you use mutexes to protect shared data.

<h3>Just because you're using a mutex, it doesn't mean that your data is safe from other threads.</h3>

I also quote this text from the 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/lecture.html>lecture
notes on race conditions.</a>:

<p>
<font color=green><b><i>I want to point out here, that
pthread_mutex_lock() does not actively "lock" other threads.
Instead, it locks a data structure, which can be shared among the
threads.  The locking and unlocking of the data structure makes
synchronization guarantees, which are very important to avoiding race
conditions.  However, I don't want you to get into the habit of
thinking that pthread_mutex_lock() actively blocks other threads, or
"locks them out." It doesn't -- it locks a data structure, and when
other threads try to lock the same data structure, they block.
Please reread this paragraph.</font></b></i>
<p>

To illustrate this, 
<b><a href=mutex_example_3.c>mutex_example_3.c</a></b> is the exact same
as 
<b><a href=mutex_example_1.c>mutex_example_1.c</a></b>, except the last thread does 
not lock or unlock the mutex.  All of the others do.  Take a look at the output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./mutex_example_3 4 10000 | head -n 20</b></font>
Thread:   1 - Begin - Counter   1.
Thread:   3 - Begin - Counter   2.
Thread:   1 - End   - Counter   2.
Thread:   3 - End   - Counter   2.
Thread 1 - Problem -- counter was 1, but now it's 2
Thread:   3 - Begin - Counter   3.
UNIX> 
</pre>

Thread 1 locks the mutex, which locks out threads 0 and 2.  However, since thread 3 is not
calling <b>pthread_mutex_lock()</b>, it goes ahead and updates the counter.  Thread 1
discovers this after it wakes up, and flags the error.  As you can see, just because
thread 0 locks the mutex, that doesn't mean that it "locks out" all of the other threads.
It works cooperatively with all of the other threads that try to lock the same mutex.

<h2>An example of multiple threads working on one problem: Determining primes</h2>

This program is slightly contrived, but it will help you with your <b>jtalk</b> 
lab.  The two files
<b><a href=numbers-100.txt>numbers-100.txt</a></b> and
<b><a href=numbers-5000.txt>numbers-5000.txt</a></b> contain 100 and 5000 large numbers (up to 16
digits), and we want to know which ones are prime numbers.  We're going to write
a multithreaded program so that multiple threads can test primality of these numbers.
The first of these is in
<b><a href=prime_example_1.c>prime_example_1.c</a></b>.  I'm only going to show
the code that the threads run.  The setup code in the <b>main()</b> thread is 
straightforward and very much like the code in the mutex examples.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Each thread will have its own private information, 
   and some shared information.  Here's the shared information. */</font>

struct shared {
  int debug;          <font color=blue>/* This is 0 or 1.  If 1, it will print more information. */</font>
};

<font color=blue>/* Here's the private information.  
   This includes a pointer to the shared information. */</font>

struct info {
  int id;
  struct shared *s;
};

<font color=blue>/* This is what each thread runs.  
   Each thread reads longs from standard input, and prints out the primes. */</font>
   
void *find_primes(void *arg)
{
  struct info *info;
  struct shared *s;
  long prime_to_test, i;
  int prime;

  info = (struct info *) arg;
  s = info-&gt;s;

  while (1) {

    <font color=blue>/* Read a number from standard input. */</font>

    if (scanf("%ld", &prime_to_test) != 1) {
      if (s-&gt;debug) printf("Thread %d - Input_over - Exiting.\n", info-&gt;id);
      return NULL;
    }

    if (s-&gt;debug) {
      printf("Thread %d testing %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
      fflush(stdout);
    }

    <font color=blue>/* Determine if the number is prime. */</font>

    prime = 1;
    for (i = 2; prime && i*i &lt;= prime_to_test; i++) {
        if (prime_to_test % i == 0) prime = 0;
    }

    if (prime) {
      printf("Thread %d found prime %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
    }
  }
}

We run this on one thread, and it finds two prime numbers in 
<b><a href=numbers-100.txt>numbers-100.txt</a></b>.  It finds a bunch more in 
<b><a href=numbers-5000.txt>numbers-5000.txt</a></b> and takes one minute and 45 seconds
on my Macbook (in 2017):

When we employ multiple threads, we get speedups up to four threads (my mac has multiple cores),
and nothing after that.  I'm piping the output to <b>wc</b> to show that I'm getting the same
number of lines of output in each case.

You'll note that this code does not have any mutexes in it.  That's because the standard I/O library is
"thread-safe" -- you don't get race conditions on that <b>scanf()</b> call.  
You can take a look at <a href=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_01>http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_01</a> if you want more information
about that...

<h3>Suppose I have a separate procedure that reads 1000 numbers at a time into a dllist</h3>

Now, suppose that instead of reading from standard input, I have a procedure called <b>read_numbers()</b>,
which reads the numbers, 1000 at a time, and puts them onto a shared Dllist.  Here's the procedure:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int read_numbers(Dllist l)
{
  int i;
  long n;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
    if (scanf("%ld", &n) != 1) {
      return (i == 0) ? 0 : 1;
    }
    dll_append(l, new_jval_l(n));
  }
  return 1;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, in 
<b><a href=prime_example_2.c>prime_example_2.c</a></b>, I add a dllist to the shared information,
and have the threads call <b>read_numbers()</b> to fill it when its empty.  Again, we are not
using any mutexes here, so there is a potential race condition, that multiple threads may call
<b>read_numbers()</b> simultaneously, and multiple threads may access and modify that dllist
simultaneously.  Regardless, here is the thread code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Each thread will have its own private information, 
   and some shared information.  Here's the shared information. 
   There's a dllist to hold the numbers to test. */</font>

struct shared {
  int nthreads;
  int debug;          <font color=blue>/* This is 0 or 1.  If 1, it will print more information. */</font>
  Dllist numbers;
};

<font color=blue>/* ... */</font>

<font color=blue>/* Find_primes now calls read_numbers() when the dllist is
   empty.  Each thread pulls numbers off the dllist to check. */</font>

void *find_primes(void *arg)
{
  struct info *info;
  struct shared *s;
  long prime_to_test, i;
  int prime;

  info = (struct info *) arg;
  s = info-&gt;S;

  while (1) {

    if (dll_empty(s-&gt;numbers)) {
      if (s-&gt;debug) {
        printf("Thread %d calling read_numbers.\n", info-&gt;id);
        fflush(stdout);
      }
      if (read_numbers(s-&gt;numbers) == 0) {
        if (s-&gt;debug) {
          printf("Thread %d exiting.\n", info-&gt;id);
          fflush(stdout);
        }
        return NULL;
      }
    }

    prime_to_test = s-&gt;numbers-&gt;flink-&gt;val.l;
    dll_delete_node(s-&gt;numbers-&gt;flink);

    if (s-&gt;debug) {
      printf("Thread %d testing %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
      fflush(stdout);
    }

    prime = 1;
    for (i = 2; prime && i*i &lt;= prime_to_test; i++) {
      if (prime_to_test % i == 0) prime = 0;
    }

    if (prime) {
      printf("Thread %d found prime %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When you run this, sometimes it works, but often (for me), you get an error on 
<b>malloc()</b> because of the race condition.  (To compile this, you may have to change
some of the initial variables in the makefile to find <b>dllist.h</b> and <b>libfdr.a</b>).

<pre>

Abort

<h3>Let's fix the race condition with a mutex</h3> 

We can fix the race condition with a simple mutex.  We make sure that that threads lock the mutex whenever they 
are accessing or modifying the <b>dllist</b>.  This code is in 
<b><a href=prime_example_3.c>prime_example_3.c</a></b>, and I just show the thread code, and the new shared
data structure.  The lock/unlock calls are highlighted by blue comments so that you can see them.

When we run it, it doesn't have any errors.  Of course, that's not a proof that it's correct,
but no matter how many times we run it, we don't get errors, so that gives us a little confidence.
That is one of the unfortunate parts of thread programming -- it's hard to really assure correctness.

You'll also note that it runs at the same speed -- the overhead in this program comes from 
calculating the primes, not reading the input.

<h3>The Condition Variable - A new synchronization primitive</h3>

Now, let's suppose that you want to have one thread that is responsible for output.
You may want to do this to process the output, or perhaps to send it to multiple socket 
connections, etc.  This is a great time to introduce a second
synchronization primitive called the "condition variable."  Like the mutex, it has
three procedures that act on it:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *cond, NULL);
int pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *lock);
int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Like the mutex, you initialize a condition variable with 
<b>pthread_cond_init</b>.  You call <b>pthread_cond_wait()</b> when you want your thread
to block.  You call it on a condition variable <i>and</i> a mutex.  You must own the lock
to the mutex when you call it.  <b>pthread_cond_wait()</b> will atomically release the 
mutex and block your thread.  
<p>
When a thread calls <b>pthread_cond_signal()</b> on a condition variable, then the thread
system checks to see if there are any threads that are blocked because they called
<b>pthread_cond_wait()</b> on that condition variable.  If there are none, then the
<b>pthread_cond_signal()</b> call does nothing.  However, if there are any threads 
that are blocked, then the thread system unblocks one of them, and it tries to re-lock
the mutex.  When it does lock the mutex, then it returns from the <b>pthread_cond_wait()</b>
call that blocked it.
<p>
Condition variables are designed for when a thread needs to block because some condition is
present in the system.  Another thread will unblock it when the condition is no longer present
by calling <b>pthread_cond_signal()</b>.
<p>
Now, in the case of our program, we are going to have the threads stop calling <b>printf()</b> when
they find prime numbers.  Instead, when a thread finds a prime number, it is going to add it to a 
dllist of prime numbers, and call <b>pthread_cond_signal()</b> on a condition variable.
We are going to have the main thread be waiting on that condition variable, and when it wakes up,
it is going to print the numbers on the dllist, and delete them.  In that way, the main thread
is the only one performing output, and the other threads communicate with it through the dllist
and the condition variable.  Of course, we will protect the dllist with a mutex.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=prime_example_4.c>prime_example_4.c</a></b>.  Here's the new shared data and
thread code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
struct shared {
  int nthreads;
  int debug;          
  pthread_mutex_t *input_lock;    <font color=blue>/* This is the lock to protect the numbers dllist */</font>
  pthread_mutex_t *output_lock;   <font color=blue>/* This is the lock to protect the primes dllist */</font>
  pthread_cond_t  *output_cond;   <font color=blue>/* The output thread (which is the main thread) 
                                     blocks on this condition variable. */</font>
  Dllist numbers;
  Dllist primes;
};

<font color=blue>/* ... */</font>

void *find_primes(void *arg)
{
  struct info *info;
  struct shared *s;
  long prime_to_test, i;
  int prime;

  info = (struct info *) arg;
  s = info-&gt;S;

  while (1) {

    pthread_mutex_lock(s-&gt;input_lock);
    if (dll_empty(s-&gt;numbers)) {
      if (s-&gt;debug) {
        printf("Thread %d calling read_numbers.\n", info-&gt;id);
        fflush(stdout);
      }
      if (read_numbers(s-&gt;numbers) == 0) {
        if (s-&gt;debug) {
          printf("Thread %d exiting.\n", info-&gt;id);
          fflush(stdout);
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;input_lock);
        return NULL;
      }
    }

    prime_to_test = s-&gt;numbers-&gt;flink-&gt;val.l;
    dll_delete_node(s-&gt;numbers-&gt;flink);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;input_lock);

    if (s-&gt;debug) {
      printf("Thread %d testing %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
      fflush(stdout);
    }

    prime = 1;
    for (i = 2; prime && i*i &lt;= prime_to_test; i++) {
      if (prime_to_test % i == 0) prime = 0;
    }

    <font color=blue>/* When we find a prime, we now add it to the primes dllist and signal 
       the condition variable to alert the printing thread to print. */</font>

    if (prime) {
      if (s-&gt;debug) {
        printf("Thread %d found prime %ld\n", info-&gt;id, prime_to_test);
        fflush(stdout);
      }
      pthread_mutex_lock(s-&gt;output_lock);
      dll_append(s-&gt;primes, new_jval_l(prime_to_test));
      pthread_cond_signal(s-&gt;output_cond);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;output_lock);
    } 
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And here's the part of the main thread that processes output:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  /* ... */
  pn = 1;
  pthread_mutex_lock(S.output_lock);
  while(1) {
    pthread_cond_wait(S.output_cond, S.output_lock);
    while (!dll_empty(S.primes)) {
      printf("Prime number %3d: %ld\n", pn, S.primes-&gt;flink-&gt;val.l);
      dll_delete_node(S.primes-&gt;flink);
      pn++;
    }
  }
  pthread_exit(NULL);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Think about the flow of control when a thread finds a prime number.  It puts the 
number onto the <b>primes</b> dllist and signals the condition variable.  That
causes the main thread to wake up, print what's on the dllist and clear the dllist.
<p>
When we run this, it works, but the program never exits:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>./prime_example_4 1 n < numbers-100.txt </b></font>
Prime number   1: 7075339107081019
Prime number   2: 8608832394453737
^C
</pre>

That's a drag.  The reason is that the main thread is blocked, and for some reason,
the threads system doesn't want to exit.  I tried putting that functionality into
another thread, and that didn't help, so we're going to have to fix this ourselves.
Fortunately, that's not too hard.
<p>
What I'm going to do is add another shared variable called <b>dead_threads</b>. When
a thread dies, it will increment this value and signal the condition variable.  Now, 
after outputting the <b>primes</b> dllist, the main thread checks to see if all
of the threads are dead.  If they are, it exits.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=prime_example_6.c>prime_example_6.c</a></b>.  Here is the code when the
threads exit:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
      if (read_numbers(s-&gt;numbers) == 0) {
        if (s-&gt;debug) {
          printf("Thread %d exiting.\n", info-&gt;id);
          fflush(stdout);
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;input_lock);
        
        <font color=blue>/* When a thread dies, update "dead_threads" and signal the condition. */</font>

        pthread_mutex_lock(s-&gt;output_lock);
        s-&gt;dead_threads++;
        pthread_cond_signal(s-&gt;output_cond);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(s-&gt;output_lock);

        return NULL;
      }
    }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And here is where the main thread checks to see if all the thread are dead, and exits:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  pn = 1;
  pthread_mutex_lock(S.output_lock);
  while(1) {
    pthread_cond_wait(S.output_cond, S.output_lock);
    while (!dll_empty(S.primes)) {
      printf("Prime number %3d: %ld\n", pn, S.primes-&gt;flink-&gt;val.l);
      dll_delete_node(S.primes-&gt;flink);
      pn++;
    }
    if (S.dead_threads == S.nthreads) exit(0);   <font color=blue>/* Check to see if all the threads are dead. */</font>
  }
    
  pthread_exit(NULL);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, we run to completion -- Yay!!

<h2>Lessons Learned from this Lecture</h2>

You've gotten further illustration of race conditions and how to help prevent them 
with a mutex.  You've also learned how to use a condition variable to control a thread
that needs to block and unblock because of certain conditions.  In this example, the
thread was a thread the processed output, and that's <i>very</i> similar to the
thread that will broadcast output in your chat server lab!
