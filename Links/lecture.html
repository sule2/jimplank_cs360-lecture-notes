<h1>Files</h1>

Files store information on <i>secondary storage.</i>  This means that the information 
should exist even when the computer that stored it is powered off.  This is as opposed
to <i>primary storage</i>, which only works while a computer is powered up, and which 
goes away forever when a computer is powered down.
<p>
When you create a file in Unix, there are quite a few things that happen.  In this lecture,
we are going to focus on three components of a file in Unix:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> The bytes of the file itself.
<LI> The metadata of the file.
<LI> The links to the file that are relative to a directory.
</UL>

Let's do a simple example:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "This is f1.txt" > f1.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -lai</b></font>
total 20
497584377 drwxr-xr-x  2 plank guest   38 Feb  3 13:54 .
430430681 drwxr-xr-x 51 plank guest 4096 Feb  3  2014 ..
497584369 -rw-r--r--  1 plank loci    15 Feb  3 13:54 f1.txt
497584451 -rw-r--r--  1 plank guest 9896 Feb  3 13:44 lecture.html
UNIX>
</pre>

We created a file called <b>f1.txt</b>, and that places three things on disk:

<UL>
<LI> A directory entry for "f1.txt" in the current directory.  That associates the
name "f1.txt" with an "inode" whose number is 497584369.  
<p>
<LI> An "Inode" with a number of 497584369.  This contains <i>metadata</i>, or information 
about the file.  Typical metadata is the size, owner, links, protection mode, latest
access and modification time, etc.  This is stored on disk in its own location -- the 
operating system knows how to find it by its inode number.
<p>
<LI>
The actual bytes, "This is f1.txt".  These are placed in a disk block, and the inode has
information on how to find the disk block.  I won't go into
much detail on this -- you'll get that in CS361.  
In this example, the file is contained
within one disk block, and the inode will know how to find it.  
</UL>

We can associate a picture with this example:
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Link-1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

You can see the inode for <b>f1.txt</b> (497584369), and how it points to 
block <tt>0x4ab</tt>, which contains
the bytes of the file (you don't have access to this information unless you are the
operating system -- I just made up the number <tt>0x4ab</tt> for the sake of the example).  
I have included the information in the directory, which is itself a
file on disk, and the inode for that file.  See how everything links together?
<p>
Also, you will note that I haven't put a null character at the end of
the string in the disk block.  That's because there is no null
character -- that is only there when you are using a string inside a
C program.  When you write it to disk, there is no null character.
<p>
When you give the <b>-i</b> flag to <b>ls</b>, it will tell you the inode number,
as in the example above.
<p>
To use Unix lingo, 
the way we name a file is by attaching a "<i>link</i>" to the inode.  
Links are stored in "<i>directories</i>" -- each entry in a directory
maps the name of the link to the inode number of the inode that
points to the file.  Again, you can see that in the example above.<p>

<p>
We can have more than one link point to a file.  Suppose we are in a 
fresh directory, and we have created the file <b>f1</b> to contain the bytes
"This is f1\n".  Moreover, suppose that file has an inode number of 34778.
And now we do the following:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln f1 f2</b></font>
</pre>
This says to create another <i>link</i> to the file <b>f1</b>, and call it "<b>f2</b>".
That link is really an entry in the directory that maps "f2" to inode 34778.
What we have now are two pointers to the same metadata and the same bytes on disk.  
When we do a listing:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li f1 f2</b></font>
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:12 f1
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:12 f2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f1</b></font>
This is f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f2</b></font>
This is f1
UNIX> 
</pre>

We see that the files are exactly the same, except that the links
have different names.  If we change either of these files -- for example,
let's edit <b>f2</b> using <b>vi</b>, and change the word 
"This" to "That", then the
change is seen in both <b>f1</b> and <b>f2</b>, because they both point to the same bytes on 
disk:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>vi f2</b></font>
...
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f2</b></font>
That is f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f1</b></font>
That is f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li f1 f2</b></font>
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f1
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f2
UNIX>
</pre>
Note that even though we only modified <b>f2</b>, the file modification time
for <b>f1</b> has changed as well.  That is because file modification time is 
stored as part of the inode -- thus, when <b>f2</b> changes it, the change
is seen in <b>f1</b> as well.  Same with file protection modes.  If we change
the protection for <b>f1</b>, then we will see the changes in <b>f2</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>chmod 0400 f1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li f1 f2</b></font>
34778  -r--------  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f1
34778  -r--------  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f2
UNIX> 
</pre>

Note the third column of the <b>ls</b> command.  It is the number of links
to the file.  If we make another link to <b>f1</b>, then this column will be
updated:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln f1 f3</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li f1 f2 f3</b></font>
34778  -r--------  3 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f1
34778  -r--------  3 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f2
34778  -r--------  3 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f3
</pre>

When we use the "<b>rm</b>" command, we are actually removing links.  E.g.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>chmod 0644 f1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>rm f1</b></font>
UNIX> ls -li f*
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f2
34778  -rw-r--r--  2 plank          11 Sep 16 10:14 f3
UNIX> 
</pre>

When the last link to a file is removed, then the file itself, inode
and all, is deleted.  As long as there is a link pointing to a file, 
however, the file remains.  It is interesting to see what happens
when files with links are overwritten.  For example, suppose I 
do the following:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat > f2</b></font>
This is now file f2
^D
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f2</b></font>
This is now file f2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f3</b></font>
This is now file f2
</pre>

By saying you want to redirect output to the file <b>f2</b>, you end up changing
<b>f3</b>.  This means that when the shell performs output redirection, it 
opens the file and truncates it, instead of removing the file and creating
it anew.<p>

Instead, suppose you do:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>gcc -o f2 ls1.c</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li f*</b></font>
34779  -rwxr-xr-x  1 plank       24576 Sep 16 10:16 f2
34778  -rw-r--r--  1 plank          20 Sep 16 10:16 f3
UNIX> 
</pre>

You'll note that the c compiler <b>gcc</b> did a "<b>rm f2</b>" before 
creating <b>f2</b> as an executable.<p>

All directories have at least 2 links:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>mkdir test</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li | grep test</b></font>
34800  drwxr-xr-x  2 plank         512 Sep 16 10:17 test
UNIX> 
</pre>

This is because every directory contains two 
subdirectories "<b>.</b>" and "<b>..</b>"
The first is a link to itself, and the second is a link to the parent
directory.  Thus, there are two links to the directory file "<b>test</b>":
"<b>test</b>" and "<b>test/.</b>"  
Similarly, suppose we make a subdirectory of <b>test</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>mkdir test/sub</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li | grep test</b></font>
34800  drwxr-xr-x  3 plank         512 Sep 16 10:17 test
UNIX> 
</pre>

Now there are three links to "<b>test</b>":  "<b>test</b>", "<b>test/.</b>", 
and "<b>test/sub/..</b>"<p>

Besides these links which are automatically created for you, you cannot
manually create links to directories.  Instead, there is a special kind of
a link called a "<i>symbolic link</i>" (also called a "soft link"), 
which you make using the command 
"<b>ln -s</b>".
For example, we can create a soft link to the test directory as follows:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln -s test test-soft</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -li | grep test</b></font>
34800  drwxr-xr-x  3 plank         512 Sep 16 10:17 test
34801  lrwxrwxrwx  1 plank           4 Sep 16 10:18 test-soft -> test
</pre>

Note that soft links have a different kind of directory listing.  Moreover,
note that the creation of a soft link to "<b>test</b>" doesn't update the link
field of test's inode.  That only records regular, or "hard" links.<p>

A soft link is a way of pointing to a file without changing the file's
inode.  However, soft links can do pretty much everything that hard links
can do:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat > f1</b></font>
This is f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln -s f1 f2</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f2</b></font>
This is f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat > f2</b></font>
This is f2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f1</b></font>
This is f2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l f*</b></font>
-rw-r--r--  1 plank          11 Sep 16 10:19 f1
lrwxrwxrwx  1 plank           2 Sep 16 10:18 f2 -> f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>chmod 0600 f2</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l f*</b></font>
-rw-------  1 plank          11 Sep 16 10:19 f1
lrwxrwxrwx  1 plank           2 Sep 16 10:18 f2 -> f1
UNIX> 
</pre>

What is the main difference between hard and soft links then?  Well,
if the file to which the soft link points gets deleted or moved, then
the link becomes unusable:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>rm f1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l f*</b></font>
lrwxrwxrwx  1 plank           2 Sep 16 10:18 f2 -> f1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat f2</b></font>
cat: f2: No such file or directory
UNIX> 
</pre>

The link is called "unresolved."<p>
<hr>

In Unix, you cannot make hard links from a file in one filesystem to a 
directory in another filesystem.  I.e., from your student accounts, you
cannot do a command such as:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln /home/plank/cs360/notes/Links/lecture.html ~/lecture.html</b></font>
</pre>

because your home directory is not on the same filesystem as mine.
However, you can make a soft link:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ln -s /home/plank/cs360/notes/Links/lecture.html ~/lecture.html</b></font>
</pre>
