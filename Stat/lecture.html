This lecture covers things that you can do with <b>stat</b>, <b>lstat</b>, 
and the <b>opendir</b> family of calls.  

<hr>
<h1>Stat</h1>
Read the man page for <b>stat</b> (or chapter 4 of the book).  <b>Stat</b> is a
command that you can use to get information about files --
information that is contained in the file's inode.  Here I'll go over
a simple motivating example.  Suppose you don't have the <b>stat</b> system
call, and you'd like to write a program that for each argument that
is a file, lists the file's size and name.  Something like the
following 
(in <a href=ls1.c><b>ls1.c</b></a>) would work: 

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;


main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i;
  int fd;
  off_t size;

  for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
    fd = open(argv[i], O_RDONLY);
    if (fd &lt; 0) {
      printf("Couldn't open %s\n", argv[i]);
    } else {
      size = lseek(fd, (off_t) 0, SEEK_END);
      printf("%10ld %s\n", size, argv[i]);
      close(fd);
    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

What it does is attempt to open each file, and then seek to the end
of the file to figure out the size.  This works ok, but copy
and compile it and then try it on the following:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls1 /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/m*</b></font>
</pre>

You'll note that it returns the following:

<pre>
       584 /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/makefile
Couldn't open /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/myfile
</pre>


Yet, when you try a regular <b>ls -l</b>, you get:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -l /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/m*</b></font>
-rw-r--r-- 1 plank guest 584 2010-02-01 18:45 /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/makefile
---------- 1 plank guest   3 1996-09-17 15:05 /home/plank/cs360/notes/Stat/myfile
UNIX>
</pre>


Since <b>ls1</b> couldn't open "<b>myfile</b>", it couldn't print out
its size.  This is unfortunate, but it also points out why we need
the "<b>stat</b>" function -- there are things about a file that it
would be nice to know, even if we're not allowed to access the file
itself.  <p>

In particular, the stat function gives you information about a file's
inode.  It can do this as long as the user has permission to get to
the directory that contains the file.<p>

Read the man page for <b>stat</b>.  The <b>stat</b> struct is defined
in <a href=file:/usr/include/sys/stat.h><b>/usr/include/sys/stat.h</b></a>,
and is roughly:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
struct stat {
          mode_t   st_mode;     /* File mode (see mknod(2)) */
          ino_t    st_ino;      /* Inode number */
          dev_t    st_dev;      /* ID of device containing */
                                /* a directory entry for this file */
          dev_t    st_rdev;     /* ID of device */
                                /* This entry is defined only for */
                                /* char special or block special files */
          nlink_t  st_nlink;    /* Number of links */
          uid_t    st_uid;      /* User ID of the file's owner */
          gid_t    st_gid;      /* Group ID of the file's group */
          off_t    st_size;     /* File size in bytes */
          time_t   st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
          time_t   st_mtime;    /* Time of last data modification */
          time_t   st_ctime;    /* Time of last file status change */
                                /* Times measured in seconds since */
          long     st_blksize;  /* Preferred I/O block size */
          long     st_blocks;   /* Number of 512 byte blocks allocated*/
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The confusing types are mostly 
ints, longs, and shorts.    I.e. from 
<a href=file:/usr/include/sys/types.h><b>/usr/include/sys/types.h</b></a>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef unsigned long   ino_t;
typedef short           dev_t;
typedef long            off_t;
typedef unsigned short  uid_t;
typedef unsigned short  gid_t;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And from <a href=file:/usr/include/sys/stdtypes.h><b>/usr/include/sys/stdtypes.h</b></a>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
typedef unsigned short  mode_t;         /* file mode bits */
typedef short           nlink_t;        /* links to a file */
typedef long            time_t;         /* value = secs since epoch */
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Once you have read this man page, it should be trivial to change
<b>ls1.c</b> to work correctly using <b>stat</b> instead of <b>open/lseek</b>.
This is in <a href=ls2.c><b>ls2.c</b></a>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;


main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int i;
  struct stat buf;
  int exists;

  for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++) {
    exists = stat(argv[i], &buf);
    if (exists &lt; 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s not found\n", argv[i]);
    } else {
      printf("%10ld %s\n", buf.st_size, argv[i]);
    }
  }
}
     

</pre></td></table></center><p>

Next, we'd like to have our "<b>ls</b>" work like the real "<b>ls</b>" 
-- have it accept no arguments, and list all files in the current directory.  To
do this, we need to use the "<b>opendir/readdir/writedir</b>" calls.  Read
the man page.  Note that these are C library calls,
and not system calls.  This means that they call
<b>open/close/read/write</b>, and interpret the format of directory files
for you.  This is convenient.  The "<b>struct dirent</b>" structure is
defined in 
<a href=file:/usr/include/sys/dirent.h><b>/usr/include/sys/dirent.h</b></a>:
<pre>
struct  dirent {
        off_t           d_off;          /* offset of next disk dir entry */
        unsigned long   d_fileno;       /* file number of entry */
        unsigned short  d_reclen;       /* length of this record */
        char            *d_name;        /* name */
};
</pre>

<a href=ls3.c><b>Ls3.c</b></a> tweaks <b>ls2.c</b> to read from
the current directory ("<b>.</b>"), and print out all files and their sizes:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct stat buf;
  int exists;
  DIR *d;
  struct dirent *de;

  d = opendir(".");
  if (d == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't open \".\"\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  for (de = readdir(d); de != NULL; de = readdir(d)) {
    exists = stat(de-&gt;d_name, &buf);
    if (exists &lt; 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s not found\n", de-&gt;d_name);
    } else {
      printf("%s %ld\n", de-&gt;d_name, buf.st_size);
    }
  }
  closedir(d);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls3</b></font>
lsc2 32700
ls5 23731
ls2.c 625
lsc2.c 860
ls5a.o 10680

ls1.c 628
ls6 23724
ls6.c 1303
ls5a 23833
...
</pre>

Now, note two things when you run <b>ls3</b> -- first, the output is
not formatted.  Second, the files aren't sorted.  This is because
<b>readdir()</b> makes no guarantees about the ordering of files in a
directory.  The next two programs solve each of these problems.<p> 

First, formatting output.  What we'd like to see is somthing like:

<pre>
lsc2              32700
ls5               23731
ls2.c               625
lsc2.c              860
ls5a.o            10680
ls4.o             10024
ls1.c               628
ls6               23724
ls6.c              1303
ls5a              23833
...
</pre>

In order to do this, we need to know how long the longest filename is
that we're going to print before we print out <i>any</i> filenames.  So, 
what we do is read all the directory entries into a linked list,
calculating the maximum length one along the way.  After doing that,
we traverse the list, and print the output in a nice format.  Look 
closely at the <b>printf</b> statement, and read the man page on printf so
that you can figure out why it works.  This is 
<a href=ls4.c><b>ls4.c</b></a>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;dirent.h&gt;
#include "dllist.h"

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  struct stat buf;
  int exists;
  DIR *d;
  struct dirent *de;
  Dllist files, tmp;
  int maxlen;

  d = opendir(".");
  if (d == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't open \".\"\n");
    exit(1);
  }
  
  maxlen = 0;
  files = new_dllist();

  for (de = readdir(d); de != NULL; de = readdir(d)) {
    dll_append(files, new_jval_s(strdup(de-&gt;d_name)));
    if (strlen(de-&gt;d_name) &gt; maxlen) maxlen = strlen(de-&gt;d_name);
  }
  closedir(d);

  dll_traverse(tmp, files) {
    exists = stat(tmp-&gt;val.s, &buf);
    if (exists &lt; 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "%s not found\n", tmp-&gt;val.s);
    } else {
      printf("%*s %10ld\n", -maxlen, tmp-&gt;val.s, buf.st_size);
    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Why did I use <b>strdup</b> in the <b>dll_append()</b> call instead of 
<b>de->d_name</b>?  The answer is subtle.  The man page doesn't tell you 
anything about how the struct that <b>readdir()</b> returns is allocated.
All that you can really assume is that until you make the next call
to <b>readdir()</b> or <b>closedir()</b>, the value of what <b>readdir()</b> 
returns is ok.  If we knew that <b>readdir()</b> mallocs space
for the "<b>struct dirent</b>" that it returns, and that that
space isn't free'd until the user calls <b>free()</b>, then we
could readily put <b>de->d_name</b> into our dlist, and not worry
about anything.  However, with no such assurances from the
man page, we have to call <b>strdup</b>.  For example,
<b>opendir/readdir/closedir</b> could be implemented as follows: 

<UL>
<LI><b>opendir()</b> opens the directory file, and mallocs one "struct dirent".
<LI><b>readdir()</b> reads the next directory entry into that one 
          "struct dirent", and returns a pointer to it.
<LI><b>closedir()</b> closes the directory file, and free's the "struct dirent".
</UL>

You should be able to reason why such an implementation necessitates
that we call <b>strdup()</b> in the <b>dll_append()</b> statement.  
If we just
put <b>de->d_name</b> there, then we're going to get into all sorts of
problems with memory.  This is subtle, but an important point.  Make sure
you understand it.


<hr>
Now, to print out the directory files sorted, you just need to
insert the entries into a red-black instead of a dllist.  The code
is in <a href=ls5.c><b>ls5.c</b></a>.  It is a very simple change.

<hr>
Next, we'd like to get rid of the %10d in the <b>printf</b> statement.
In other words, we want 
one space between the last column of the file names and the first
column of the file sizes.  We do this by finding the maximum
size of the file size while traversing the directory, and using 
that in the <b>printf</b> statement.  This takes a <b>sprintf</b> and a 
<b>strlen</b> -- see <a href=ls5a.c><b>ls5a.c</b></a>.

<hr>
Finally, <a href=ls6.c><b>ls6.c</b></a> performs the same function as 
"<b>ls -F</b>".  That is, it prints
directories with a "<b>/</b>" at the end, symbolic (soft) links with a 
"<b>@</b>", and executable files with a "<b>*</b>".  
We are able to do this by interpreting 
the "<b>st_mode</b>" field of the "<b>struct buf</b>".  Look over the
code.
