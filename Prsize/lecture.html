To "follow along" with these lecture notes, if you are on the lab
machines, simply do:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd /home/plank/cs360/notes/Prsize/test1</b></font>
</pre>

If you are on your own machine, then follow these instructions:
<p>
Pull the repo, and cd to the <tt>Prsize</tt> directory.  You'll
need to change the makefile so that it works on your machine.  Here's
what my makefile looks like on my home machine:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 4 makefile</b></font>
CC = gcc

CFLAGS  =       -g -I$(HOME)/include
LIB = $(HOME)/lib/libfdr.a
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make</b></font>
gcc -g -I/home/plank/include -c prsize1.c
gcc -g -I/home/plank/include -o prsize1 prsize1.o
...
UNIX> 
</pre>

Next, untar the test directories.  This is because bitbucket doesn't
do a good job of preserving soft links and directory protections:
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>tar xpfv test-directories.tar</b></font>
test1/
test1/d1/
test1/d1/f3
test1/f1
test1/f2
test2/
test2/f4-soft
.....
UNIX>
</pre>

Finally:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd test1</font></b>
</pre>

Now, you're set up.

<hr>
This lecture covers the writing of a command <b>prsize</b>.  What
<b>prsize</b> does is return the number of bytes taken up by all files
reachable from the current directory (excluding soft links).  It is a
good program as it illustrates using <b>opendir/readdir/closedir</b>,
<b>stat</b>, recursion, building path names, and finding hard links.<p>

<p>
First, I wrote 
<a href=prsize1.c><b>prsize1.c</b></a>.
This prints the total size of all files in
the current directory.  It is a simple use of <tt>stat</tt> and 
<tt>opendir/readdir/closedir</tt>.
Test it out on your current directory (which is <tt>test1</tt>):

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize1 </b></font>
4170
</pre>

You may get a different value (e.g. on my home machine, I got 12314), but
if you do a long listing of all files, your value should equal the sum of
all of the file sizes.  For example:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -la</b></font>
total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 3 plank guest   33 Feb 11 14:00 .
drwxr-xr-x. 7 plank guest 4096 Feb 11 14:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 2 plank guest   15 Sep 23  1994 d1
-rw-r--r--. 1 plank guest   11 Sep 23  1994 f1
-rw-r--r--. 1 plank guest   15 Sep 23  1994 f2
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "33 4096 + 15 + 11 + 15 + p" | dc</b></font>
4170
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, the next step we'd like to take is
to get the program to sum up the sizes of all files
<i>reachable</i> from the current directory.  To do this, we
need to make the program recursive.  Instead of putting all
our code in the <b>main()</b> routine, we'll instead bundle it
into a function, and call that function.  
<a href=prsize2.c><b>Prsize2.c</b></a>
does this.  It provides the same functionality as <b>prsize1.c</b>,
except that it makes a call to <b>get_size()</b> to find the size.
Note there is no recursion yet -- that is for <b>prsize3.c</b>.
If you test <b>prsize2</b>, you'll see that it does the same thing
as <b>prsize1</b>. 

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize2 </b></font>
4170
UNIX>
</pre>

Now, we want to make <b>prsize2</b> recursive.  Whenever we encounter a
directory, we want to find out the size of everything in that
directory, so we will call <b>get_size()</b> recursively on that directory.
This is done in 
<a href=prsize3.c><b>prsize3.c</b></a>.
Try it out:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize3</b></font>
prsize: Too many open files
UNIX>
</pre>

So, what's happening?  Well, to check, I put a print statement into 
<a href=prsize3a.c><b>prsize3a.c</b></a>
to see when it's making the recursive calls:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize3a</b></font>
Making recursive call on directory .
Making recursive call on directory .
Making recursive call on directory .
Making recursive call on directory .
....
prsize: Too many open files
UNIX>
</pre>

Now you can see what's happening.  When enumerating files in ".", you 
come across the file ".".  This is a directory, so you make a recursive call
on it.  This goes into an infinite loop until you run out of open file 
discriptors at which point <b>opendir()</b> fails.  
To fix this, you need to check
and see whether or not you are trying to make a recursive call to the "."
directory.  You need to check for ".." as well.  
<a href=prsize4.c><b>Prsize4.c</b></a>
puts in this code.  Now try it out:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize4</b></font>
Couldn't stat f3
UNIX>
</pre>

Ok, now what's the problem?  Well, the program is
trying to stat <b>f3</b> in the directory <b>d1</b>, but it's not
working in the directory <b>d1</b>.  In other words, <b>prsize4</b>
is called from the directory
<b>/home/plank/cs360/notes/Prsize/test1</b>, and
makes the call "<b>exists = stat("f3", &buf)</b>".  Of course
stat is going to return -1, because there is no file
<b>f3</b> in the directory.  Instead, we need to look for
"<b>d1/f3</b>".  In other words, our code has a bug -- we
need to be looking for <b>fn/de->d_name</b> in <b>get_size()</b>,
and not just <b>de->d_name</b>.  
<a href=prsize5.c><b>Prsize5.c</b></a>
makes this change.  

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize5</b></font>
4170
</pre>

So, this looks ok, except there's still something wrong:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -la</b></font>
total 12
drwxr-xr-x. 3 plank guest   33 Feb 11 14:00 .
drwxr-xr-x. 7 plank guest 4096 Feb 11 14:00 ..
drwxr-xr-x. 2 plank guest   15 Sep 23  1994 d1

-rw-r--r--. 1 plank guest   15 Sep 23  1994 f2

total 4
drwxr-xr-x. 2 plank guest 15 Sep 23  1994 .
drwxr-xr-x. 3 plank guest 33 Feb 11 14:00 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 plank guest 17 Sep 23  1994 f3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "4170 15 + 33 + 17 + p" | dc</b></font>
4235
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

As you can see, <b>prsize5</b> is counting <b>d1</b> and <b>d1/.</b> as
separate files, and adding both of their sizes into the total.  Same
for <b>.</b> and <b>d1/..</b> <p>

This is a drag.  To be clearer, look in <b>test2</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd ../test2</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize5</b></font>
4152
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -lai</b></font>

486036512 -rw-r--r--. 2 plank guest   11 Sep 23  1994 f4

</pre>


The files <b>f4</b> and <b>f4-hard-link</b> are links to the same
file, so we really shouldn't count them twice.  
However, <b>prsize5</b> counts them as being
different.  So, what we need is for <b>prsize</b> to be able
to recognize hard links, and only count them once.<p>

How do you recognize whether two files are links to
the same disk file?  You use the inode number.  This
is held in <b>buf.st_ino</b>.<p>

Now, the way we check for duplicate inodes is to
maintain a rb-tree of inodes that we have seen so far.
Before adding in the size of any file, we check to see
if its inode is in the rb-tree.  If so, we do nothing.
Otherwise, we add in the size, and put the inode into
the rb-tree.  
As inodes are ints, we can use
<b>jrb_insert_int</b> and <b>jrb_find_int</b> to access and modify the
red-black tree.  
<font color=darkred>(Caveat starting in 2015 -- inode numbers are now longs on some systems,
so using jrb_find_int()</b> is not technically the right thing to use any more.  However, I'm not going to
change the notes because it won't matter functionally unless you have two inodes whose
lower 32 bits are identical.  I'm tempted to <b>memcpy()</b> the inode into a double and
use <b>jrb_find_dbl()</b> -- I'll probably do that when I teach it, even though it's kind 
of disgusting.  What I need to do is add <b>_long()</b> to the JRB library, but
I don't see myself doing that any time soon.)</font>
<p>
The code is in 
<a href=prsize6.c><b>prsize6.c</b></a>.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize6</b></font>
4141                    <font color=blue>This is 11 less than before, so it's correct.</font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd ../test1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize6</b></font>
4187                    <font color=blue>This is 48 less than before, so it's correct as it's not double-counting . and d1.</font>
UNIX>
</pre>


Now, soft links present a small problem.  Look at the <b>test3</b> directory.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd ../test3</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>ls -la</b></font>
total 8
drwxr-xr-x. 2 plank guest   55 Sep 24  1996 .
drwxr-xr-x. 7 plank guest 4096 Feb 11 14:00 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 plank guest   11 Sep 23  1994 f5
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 plank loci     2 Aug  1  2014 f5-soft-link -> f5
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 plank loci     1 Aug  1  2014 soft-link-to-. -> .
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize6</b></font>
Couldn't stat ./soft-link-to-./soft-link-to-./soft-link-to-./soft-link-to-.........
prsize: Too many levels of symbolic links
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

So, what has happened?  Since we're using <b>stat()</b>,
<b>prsize6</b> doesn't recognize soft links, and thus we have
the same infinite loop problem as before.  It should
be clear what we want -- instead of traversing the
link to ".", we want <b>prsize</b> to count the size of the
link itself (2 bytes for <b>f5-soft-link</b> and 1 byte for
<b>soft-link-to-.</b>).  Thus, all we need to do in 
<a href=prsize7.c><b>prsize7.c</b></a>
is use <b>lstat()</b> instead of <b>stat()</b>.  This gives
information about the soft link itself, instead of the
file to which the link points: 

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize7</b></font>
4165
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo "55 4096 + 11 + 2 + 1 + p" | dc</b></font>
4165
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Finally, there's one more bug in this program, and it's really subtle.  
It has to do with open file descriptors.  First, go to the directory 
<b>test4</b>.  Below, I use the <tt>find</tt> command to show that it is
composed of 10 nested directories.  You can see that <b>prsize7</b> works
just fine on it:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cd ../test4</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>find . -print</b></font>
.
./1
./1/2
./1/2/3
./1/2/3/4
./1/2/3/4/5
./1/2/3/4/5/6
./1/2/3/4/5/6/7
./1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8
./1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize7</b></font>
4228
UNIX>
</pre>

The reason that it works is that our defaults typically allow for 256 open
files per process:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>limit | grep descriptors</b></font>
descriptors  256 
UNIX>
</pre>

Let's use the <tt>limit</tt> command to set this number to ten instead 
of 256.  Now, <b>prsize7</b> fails because of too many open files:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>limit descriptors 10</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize7</b></font>
prsize: Too many open files
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

What's happening is that the recursive calls to
<b>get_size()</b> are made in between the <b>opendir()</b> and
<b>closedir()</b> calls.  That means that each time we make a
recursive call, we add one to the number of open
files.  With only ten open files (and three open to start the process),
we run out of file descriptors when we try to open
<tt>"./1/2/3/4/5/6/7"</tt>.

<p>
The
solution to this is to make sure that there are no
open files when we make the recursive call.  How do we
do this?  When enumerating the files in a directory,
we put all directories into a dllist, and then after
closing the directory file, we traverse the list and
make the recursive calls.  We need to do a
<b>strdup()</b> when we put the directories into the
dllist.  Why?  Think it over,
or see what happens when you don't
do it, and you try run the program on the <b>test5</b>
directory.<p> 

The correct and final version of prsize is in 
<a href=prsize8.c><b>prsize8.c</b></a>.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>../prsize8</b></font>

As an aside, <b>find</b> has the same bug as <b>prsize7.c</b>:

</pre>

When I first wrote this lecture, in the mid 1990's, I had <b>test4</b> have
257 subdirectories, rather than 10.  That way, I didn't have mess with the 
<b>limit</b> command.  Within a day, I had an email from our system administrator,
complaining that the directory broke the system backup program.  It also
broke <b>tar</b>.  So, I changed the directory to its current structure.
I like to think that the good folks who write system tools fixed <b>tar</b>
because they stumbled upon my lecture notes.  A man can dream, can't he?
