<hr>

This lecture is a continuation of computer organization & stack frames.  
The focus is on procedure calls.  <p>

Look at the following C code
(<b><a href=p1.c>p1.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int a()
{
  return 1;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = a();
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This compiles into assembler that looks like the following:

<pre>
    a:
	mov #1 -> %r0
	ret
    main:
	push #4
	jsr a
	st %r0 -> [fp]
	ret
</pre>

Both of these procedure calls are straightforward.  <b>Main()</b> first allocates
one variable on the stack, and then calls "<b>jsr a</b>", which means
jump to subroutine <b>a</b>.  Once <b>a()</b> returns, it stores the
value in register <b>r0</b> to the local variable <b>i</b>, which has
been allocated to be the variable pointed to by the frame pointer.
Then <b>main()</b> exits.  <b>A()</b> is straightforward as well.  It
returns the value 1 by storing it in register <b>r0</b>, and then
returning.<p>

This seems simple, but what goes on when <b>jsr</b> and <b>ret</b> are
called is a little trickier.  This is what happens:<p>

When "<b>jsr</b>" is called, <b>(pc+4)</b> and the current value of
<b>fp</b> are both stored on the top of the stack.  Then, the <b>fp</b>
is changed to be the current <b>sp</b>, and <b>pc</b> is changed to be
the location of the first instruction of the named procedure.  This
is done atomically by the computer's hardware.  After <b>jsr</b> has
taken effect, we are in a new stack frame, and the <b>pc</b> is
executing <b>a()</b>.<p>

When "<b>ret</b>" is called, the <b>sp</b> is changed to be the current
<b>fp</b>.  Then the <b>fp</b> is popped off the stack: it is set to be
the top stack value, and the <b>sp</b> is decremented by 4.  Finally,
the <b>pc</b> is popped off the stack: it is set to be the top stack
value, and the <b>sp</b> is again decremented by 4.  Like "<b>jsr</b>",
this is all done atomically by the hardware.  When "<b>ret</b>"
completes, the <b>pc</b> is set to be the instruction after the
original "<b>jsr</b>", and the stack frame of that procedure has been
restored.<p>

Let's look at it pictorally (you should use <b>jassem.tcl</b> to do
this for yourself).  At the start, the stack and registers
look as follows:<p> 

<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |                       | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r3
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r4
        |    unused      |           /-------- |                       | sp
        |    unused      | <------------------ |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | main: push #4         | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>

First, the <b>sp</b> is decremented by 4 to allocate the local variable <b>i</b>:

<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |                       | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2 
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r3 
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r4 
        |    unused      | <------------------ |                       | sp
        |    main: i     | <------------------ |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | main+4: jsr a         | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>

Now <b>jsr</b> is called.  This pushes <b>pc+4</b> and the
value of the <b>fp</b> on the stack, and sets the <b>fp</b> to
the new <b>sp</b>, and <b>pc</b> to <b>a</b>: 

<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |                       | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2 
        |    unused      | <---\---\           |                       | r3 
    /---| old fp         |      \   \          |                       | r4 
    |   | old pc: main+8 |       \   \-------  |                       | sp
    \-->|    main: i     |        \----------- |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | a: mov #1 -> %r0      | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>

Note now that we have a new stack frame for <b>a</b>, 
and the <b>pc</b> is executing <b>a</b>.
The first thing it does is load <b>1</b> into <b>r0</b>:


<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |       1               | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2
        |    unused      | <---\---\           |                       | r3
    /---| old fp         |      \   \          |                       | r4 
    |   | old pc: main+8 |       \   \-------  |                       | sp
    \-->|    main: i     |        \----------- |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | a+4: ret              | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>
          
And then call "<b>ret</b>".  "<b>Ret</b>" sets the <b>sp</b> to the <b>fp</b>
(which involves nothing in this case), and then
pops the <b>fp</b> and the <b>pc</b> off the stack.  When it's
done we're back to <b>main()</b>'s stack frame, and
executing the next instruction after the <b>jsr</b>: 


<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |       1               | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r3
        | old fp         |                     |                       | r4
        | old pc: main+8 |<------------------- |                       | sp
        |    main: i     |<------------------- |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | main+8: st %r0->[fp]  | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>


Note the "old fp" and "old pc" don't get changed. However since they are
"above the stack", they should not get referenced.
Now the "<b>st %r0 -> [fp]</b>" gets executed, and the machine state looks like:

<pre>
              Stack                              registers
        |----------------|                     |-----------------------|
        |                |                     |       1               | r0
        |                |                     |                       | r1
        |    .....       |                     |                       | r2
        |    unused      |                     |                       | r3
        | old fp         |                     |                       | r4
        | old pc: main+8 |<------------------- |                       | sp
        |    main: i: 1  |<------------------- |                       | fp
        |     used       |                     | main+12: ret          | pc
        |     ....       |                     |-----------------------|
        |--------------- |
</pre>

Now <b>main()</b> is over, and calls "<b>ret</b>".  You can imagine
what this does -- the stack is set up so that when <b>main()</b> calls
<b>ret</b>, control returns to the operating system and the process
goes away.  

<p>
Now, make sure you go over this with <b>Jassem</b>.  The program is
in <a href=p1.jas><b>p1.jas</b></a>, and you should see exactly what
I have showed above, only you get to see all the memory addresses
as well.

<hr>

This next example shows a procedure with arguments and local variables
(<b><a href=p2.c>p2.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int a(int i)
{
  int j;

  j = i+1;
  return j;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = a(5);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This gets compiled into code like the following:


<pre>
    a:
	push #4
	ld [fp+12] -> %r0
	add %r0, %g1 -> %r0
	st %r0 -> [fp]
	ld [fp] -> %r0
	ret
    main:
	push #4 
        mov #5 -> %r0
        st %r0 -> [sp]--
	jsr a
	pop #4 
	st %r0 -> [fp]
	ret
</pre>

The only real difference between this example and
the last is the argument to <b>a()</b>.  It should be
clear how <b>a</b> allocates its local variable <b>j</b> on the
stack by decrementing the stack pointer ("push #4").  <b>j</b> is
then referenced as the location pointed to by the
frame pointer.  Arguments are passed from the
calling procedure by pushing them onto the stack
in reverse order (here there is only one
argument), and then calling <b>jsr</b>.  The procedure
knows how to reference the arguments -- they
start at the memory location 12 bytes ahead of
the <b>fp</b>.  Why?  Well, <b>[fp]</b> points to the beginning
of the frame.  <b>[fp+4]</b> points to the old frame
pointer, and <b>[fp+8]</b> points to the <b>pc</b> to return to
when the procedure is over.  Thus, if the
arguments are pushed onto the stack directly
before calling <b>jsr</b>, then they start at <b>[fp+12]</b>.  

<p>
Pushing them in reverse order, means that the first argument is always 
at <b>[fp+12]</b>.  The second argument is at <b>[fp+16]</b>.  The third
argument is at <b>[fp+20]</b>, and so on.
<p>
This program is in <a href=p2.jas><b>p2.jas</b></a>, and you should
trace through it using <b>Jassem</b>.  Make sure you understand
how <b>main</b> pushes its argument on the stack, how <b>a</b> finds
the argument, and what happens on <b>jsr/ret</b>.
<p>
 
<hr>
<h2>Register Spilling</h2>

One important thing that has to
be decided is whether a procedure may use a
register without worrying about its current value
(like <b>a()</b> does with <b>r0</b>), or whether a procedure
should first save the register on the stack
before using it.  This matters, because suppose
for example, that the main routine uses register
<b>r3</b>, then calls "<b>jsr a</b>", and afterwards expects <b>r3</b>
to have the same value.  Then <b>a()</b> and any
procedures that <b>a()</b> calls must make sure not to
use <b>r3</b>, or to save <b>r3</b>'s value before using it,
and restore it when its done.  
<p>
The act of saving a register's value before the body of a procedure
call and restoring it afterwards is called <i>spilling</i>.
Different machines and compilers handle spilling in different ways.  For
example, older CISC architectures sometimes had a spill-mask that 
would be part of a procedure call.  This specified which registers should
be spilled, and the machine actually did the spilling for you.
<p>
What we do on our machine is a typical spilling solution:
Procedures can use <b>r0</b> and <b>r1</b> without worrying
about their values.  However, registers <b>r2</b> through 
<b>r4</b> must be spilled if a procedure uses them.
<p>
Here's an example
(<b><a href=spill1.c>spill1.c</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int a(int i, int j)
{
  int k;

  k = (i+2)*(j-5);
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = a(44, 22);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

To compile arithmetic expressions into assembler, it's useful to turn them
into trees.  For example, the above expression becomes:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

In order to evaluate the tree, you need to do a 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs140/Notes/Trees/index.html>
postorder traversal</a> (or, 
if you think of the edges are pointing upward, you need to do a <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Topological/>topological sorting</a> of the tree).  
Arithmetic has to be done on a register-by-register basis, so each of those nodes
must be in a register. You (the compiler) must figure out an ordering of instructions
that is legal, and then an assignment of nodes to registers so that you don't reuse
registers unless you can be sure that you don't need their values any more.  
<p>For 
example, in the above expression, suppose you do the (i+2) calculation first and 
hold the result in <b>r0</b>.  Then you can't use <b>r0</b> to calculate (j-5). 
For that reason, you are going to have to use <b>r2</b>, and because you are using
<b>r2</b>, you'll have to spill it onto the stack.  I do this at the beginning of
a procedure.  Then at the end, I "unspill" it by reading it back from the stack.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=spill1.jas>spill1.jas</a></b>, which I've reproduced below.  You 
may use <b>jassem.tcl</b> to step through this.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
a:
    push #4              <font color=blue>/ Allocate k</font>
    st %r2 -&gt; [sp]--     <font color=blue>/ Spill r2</font>

    ld [fp+12] -&gt; %r0
    mov #2 -&gt; %r1
    add %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0  <font color=blue>/ Calculate (i+2) and put the result in r0</font>

    ld [fp+16] -&gt; %r1
    mov #5 -&gt; %r2
    sub %r1, %r2 -&gt; %r1  <font color=blue>/ Calculate (j-5) and put the result in r1</font>

    mul %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]       <font color=blue>/ Do k = r0 * r1</font>

    ld [fp] -&gt; %r0
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r2     <font color=blue>/ Unspill r2</font>
    ret

main:

    push #4              <font color=blue>/ Allocate i</font>
 
    mov #22 -&gt; %r0       <font color=blue>/ Push arguments onto the stack in reverse order</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    mov #44 -&gt; %r0       
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #8               <font color=blue>/ Always pop the arguments off the stack after jsr</font>

    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]
    ret
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Note, that you have to spill <b>r2</b> onto the stack <i>after</i> allocating
the local variable.   Otherwise, <b>k</b> will not be at <b>[fp]</b>.  Think
about it.
    
<hr>
<h2>An example to show why spilling matters</h2>

Take a look at
<b><a href=spill2.c>spill2.c</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int a(int i, int j)
{
  int k;

  k = (i+2)*(j-5);
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = (a(10, 20) + a(30, 40));
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll note that <b>a()</b> is exactly the same.  The only difference is that
we're calling <b>a()</b> twice, and adding up the return values.  Think about
that for a minute -- where should you store the return value of the first 
call to <b>a()</b>?  You can't store it in <b>r0</b> or <b>r1</b> because 
making a procedure call will destroy them (we have to assume that).
Therefore, you have to store it in a higher register, like <b>r2</b>.
You know that's ok, because <b>a()</b> will make sure that <b>r2</b>'s value is 
unchanged.  Here's the code for <b>main()</b> (in
<b><a href=spill2.jas>spill2.jas</a></b>).  You'll notice that <b>main()</b> spills
<b>r2</b> as well, because if any procedure uses
<b>r2</b>, <b>r3</b> or <b>r4</b>, it must spill them.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
main:

Once again, I urge you to trace through this code with <b>jassem</b> to see
how the spilling works.
<hr>
<h2>What do you do when you run out of registers?</h2>

Try 
<b><a href=spill3.c>spill3.c</a></b> on for size:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int a(int i)
{
  return i+5;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = ( (a(2)+a(3)) * (a(4)+a(5)) + (a(10)+a(11)) * (a(12)+a(13)) ) *
      ( (a(6)+a(7)) * (a(8)+a(9)) + (a(14)+a(15)) * (a(16)+a(17)) );
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Yuck.  Here's the expression tree:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3.jpg></td></table></center><p>

You can see I've labeled it with the registers that you can use if you do the 
calculation in post-order, from left to right.   You'll see that we've run
out of registers!
<p>
Below, I show how you handle that -- you spill the intermediate value shown 
as "Spill". That allows you to use <b>r2</b> again, and you no longer run out
of registers.  Before you do the last multiplication, you unspill the value into
a register:


<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3A.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Did you really want to see the assembler for that?  It's in 
<b><a href=spill3.jas>spill3.jas</a></b>.  It's not that hard to read.  Here's
the crucial code: Spilling the result of the sum (by the "Spill" in the picture
above) onto the stack.  I start with the call to <b>a(13)</b>.  When it's done,
you perform the multiplication and addition, and then spill the result of the
addition onto the stack.  Then you start working on the right side of the equation
(starting with <b>a(6)</b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    ...
    mov #13 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    add %r0, %r4 -&gt; %r0

    mul %r3, %r0 -&gt; %r0   <font color=blue>/ Multiplication, then Addition, then spill</font>
    add %r2, %r0 -&gt; %r0   
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--

    mov #6 -&gt; %r0          <font color=blue>/ a(6)+a(7)</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    mov %r0 -&gt; %r2
    ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>

At the end, when you're done with <b>a(17)</b>, you do the multiplication
and addition.  You have one more multiplication, but its operand is the
one spilled to the stack.  You unspill it and perform the multiplication.
Then you're done!

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
    ...
    mov #17 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    add %r0, %r4 -&gt; %r0

    mul %r3, %r0 -&gt; %r0   <font color=blue>/ Multiplication, then addition, then unspill and multiply</font>
    add %r2, %r0 -&gt; %r0   
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r1
    mul %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0

    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]        <font color=blue>/ Store the result into i</font>

    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r4      <font color=blue>/ Unspill before returning</font>
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r3
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r2
    ret
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You can run <b>jassem</b> on this -- it's a bit cumbersome, but I have important
screen shots.  Here is the state just before the crucial spill:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3-SS-1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

You can double-check yourself -- <b>a(i)</b> simply adds 5 to <b>i</b>, so:

<UL>
<LI> <b>r4</b> should equal (12+5) = 17 = 0x11.  
<LI> <b>r3</b> should equal (10+5+11+5) = 31 = 0x1f.  
<LI> <b>r2</b> should equal (2+5+3+5)*(4+5+5+5) = 15*19 = 285 = 0x11d
</UL>

After the spill, 0x55a goes onto the stack:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3-SS-2.jpg></td></table></center><p>

I continue stepping to the "unspill":

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3-SS-3.jpg></td></table></center><p>

And at the end, <b>i</b> has been set to 0x3009e4 = 3148620.  Is that right?
I'll let you double-check it yourself, but it is indeed correct!

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Spill-3-SS-4.jpg></td></table></center><p>
