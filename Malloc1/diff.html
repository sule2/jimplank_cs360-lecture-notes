Each system implements <b>malloc()</b> in its own way.  The description that
I give in class is how Solaris systems implemented <b>malloc()</b> and 
<b>free()</b> in 1996.  I use it because it is easy to explain.  
<p>
When you run <b>fb4</b> on current machines, the output will be different.
For example, here is the output on a Cetus lab machine in 1999:
<pre>
UNIX> <b>fb4</b>
sbrk(0) = 0x20b08
Allocated 4 bytes.  buf = 0x20b18, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 9, buf[0] = 1000
Allocated 8 bytes.  buf = 0x20b28, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 9, buf[0] = 1001
Allocated 12 bytes.  buf = 0x20f20, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 17, buf[0] = 1002
Allocated 16 bytes.  buf = 0x20f38, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 17, buf[0] = 1003
Allocated 20 bytes.  buf = 0x21528, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 25, buf[0] = 1004
Allocated 24 bytes.  buf = 0x21548, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 25, buf[0] = 1005
Allocated 28 bytes.  buf = 0x21d30, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 33, buf[0] = 1006
Allocated 100 bytes.  buf = 0x22730, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 105, buf[0] = 1007
sbrk(0) = 0x22b08
UNIX> 
</pre>

This is different from the 1996 output, but as you can see, it
is functionally equivalent -- the value in the word two words before the
returned pointer is seven less than the number of bytes allocated.  Why?
I don't know -- but all you have to do is add seven to it to get the chunk size.
<p>
The Pentium box on my desk in 2002 had the following output:
<pre>
UNIX> <b>fb4</b>
sbrk(0) = 0x8049778
Allocated 4 bytes.  buf = 0x8049780, buf[-1] = 17, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1000
Allocated 8 bytes.  buf = 0x8049790, buf[-1] = 17, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1001
Allocated 12 bytes.  buf = 0x80497a0, buf[-1] = 17, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1002
Allocated 16 bytes.  buf = 0x80497b0, buf[-1] = 25, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1003
Allocated 20 bytes.  buf = 0x80497c8, buf[-1] = 25, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1004
Allocated 24 bytes.  buf = 0x80497e0, buf[-1] = 33, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1005
Allocated 28 bytes.  buf = 0x8049800, buf[-1] = 33, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1006
Allocated 100 bytes.  buf = 0x8049820, buf[-1] = 105, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1007
sbrk(0) = 0x804a000
</pre>
So now the size information is in the first word before the pointer.
It appears to be the size of the chunk plus one.
You'll also note that <b>malloc(12)</b> allocates 16 bytes instead of 24.  Why?  Because
it's only using four bytes for bookkeeping -- we pad to the next value of <i>i</i> 
such that <i>i%8 = 4</i>.
<p>
Why then does <b>malloc(4)</b> allocate 16 bytes?  Internal fragmentation I'm sure -- the
size of a free list node has to be greater than 8 bytes.
<p>
Here's the output on a DECstation running Ultrix in 2002:
<pre>
UNIX> <b>fb4</b>
sbrk(0) = 0x10001100
Allocated 4 bytes.  buf = 0x10005000, buf[-1] = 268435695, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1000
Allocated 8 bytes.  buf = 0x10006000, buf[-1] = 268435951, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1001
Allocated 12 bytes.  buf = 0x10006010, buf[-1] = 268435951, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1002
Allocated 16 bytes.  buf = 0x10007000, buf[-1] = 268436207, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1003
Allocated 20 bytes.  buf = 0x10007020, buf[-1] = 268436207, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1004
Allocated 24 bytes.  buf = 0x10007040, buf[-1] = 268436207, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1005
Allocated 28 bytes.  buf = 0x10007060, buf[-1] = 268436207, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1006
Allocated 100 bytes.  buf = 0x10008000, buf[-1] = 268436719, buf[-2] = 0, buf[0] = 1007
sbrk(0) = 0x10008ffc
UNIX> 
</pre>
There's an odd one -- Any clues?  When I turn the <b>int</b>'s 
into <b>shorts</b> in <b>fb5.c</b>, I get:
<pre> 
UNIX> <b>fb5</b>
sbrk(0) = 0x10001100
Allocated 4 bytes.  buf = 0x10005000, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 239, buf[0] = 1000
Allocated 8 bytes.  buf = 0x10006000, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 495, buf[0] = 1001
Allocated 12 bytes.  buf = 0x10006010, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 495, buf[0] = 1002
Allocated 16 bytes.  buf = 0x10007000, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 751, buf[0] = 1003
Allocated 20 bytes.  buf = 0x10007020, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 751, buf[0] = 1004
Allocated 24 bytes.  buf = 0x10007040, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 751, buf[0] = 1005
Allocated 28 bytes.  buf = 0x10007060, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 751, buf[0] = 1006
Allocated 100 bytes.  buf = 0x10008000, buf[-1] = 4096, buf[-2] = 1263, buf[0] = 1007
sbrk(0) = 0x10008ffc

Odd indeed.  Can you guess at an explanation?  I think I can, but I don't have the time
to make sure it's correct.  I'll talk about it in class.
